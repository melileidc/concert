AUTHOR: DISMUS MELILEI

For this assignment, we'll be working with a Concert domain.

We have three models: Band(name and hometown),Venue(title and city), and Concert.

For our purposes, a Band has many Concerts, a Venue has many Concerts, 
and a Concert belongs to a Band and to a Venue.

Band - Venue is a many to many relationship.

Note: You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard before you 
start coding. 

***Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.

 
Topics

    SQLAlchemy Migrations
    SQLAlchemy Relationships
    Class and Instance Methods
    SQLAlchemy Querying

 
What You Should Have:
 Your schema should look like this:

 

Bands Table

Column
	

Type

name
	

String

hometown
	

String

 

venues Table

Column
	

Type

title
	

String

city
	

String

 

You will need to create a schema for the concerts table using the attributes specified in the deliverables below. 

You will also need to create the migrations for the above tables using the attributes specified in the deliverables below
Deliverables

Write the following methods in the classes you will write. Feel free to build out any helper methods if needed.

Remember: SQLAlchemy gives your classes access to a lot of methods already! Keep in mind what methods SQLAlchemy gives you access to on each of your classes when you're approaching the deliverables below.
Migrations

Before working on these deliverables, you will need to create migrations for the concerts  tables. This is assuming you had already created and migrated the band and venues table above.

    A Concert belongs to a Band, and a Concert also belongs to a Venue. In your migration, create any columns your concerts table will need to establish these relationships.
    The concerts table should also have:
        A date column that stores an string.

After creating the concerts table using a migration, create instances of your classes so you can test your code.

Once you've set up your tables, work on building out the following deliverables.

 
Object Relationship Methods

Use SQLAlchemy query methods where appropriate.
Concert

    Concert band()
        should return the Band instance for this Concert
    Concert venue()
        should return the Venue instance for this Concert

Venue

    Venue concerts()
        returns a collection of all the concerts for the Venue
    Venue bands()
        returns a collection of all the bands who performed at the Venue

Band

    Band concerts()
        should return a collection of all the concerts that the Band has played
    Band venues()
        should return a collection of all the venues that the Band has performed at

 

Ensure these methods work before proceeding. For example, you should be able to call session. query(Band).first().venues and see a list of the venues for the first band in the database based on your test data, and session. query(Band).first() should return the band for the first concert in the database.
Aggregate and Relationship Methods
Concert

    Concert hometown_show()
        returns true if the concert is in the band's hometown, false if it is not
    Concert introduction()
        returns a string with the band's introduction for this concert
        an introduction is in the form:

"Hello {insert venue city}!!!!! We are {insert band name} and we're from {insert band hometown}"
Band

    Band play_in_venue(venue, date)
        takes a venue (Venue instance) and date (as a string) as arguments
        creates a new concert for the band in that venue on that date\
    Band all_introductions()
        returns an array of strings representing all the introductions for this band
        each introduction is in the form:

"Hello {insert venue city}!!!!! We are {insert band name} and we're from {insert band hometown}"

    Band most_performances() class method
        returns the Band instance for the band that has played the most concerts
        Note: solving this using only SQLAlchemy methods is possible, but difficult. Feel free to use regular Python enumerable methods here.

Venue

    Venue concert_on(date)
        takes a date (string) as an argument
        finds and returns the first concert on that date at that venue
    Venue most_frequent_band()
        returns the band with the most concerts at the venue
        Note: solving this using only SQLAlchemy methods is possible, but difficult. Feel free to use regular Python enumerable methods here.
